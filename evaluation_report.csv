What are the reporting requirements for State Parties?,"State Parties are required to make their reports widely available to the public in their own countries. The Committee examines these reports and may transmit comments to the State Party, which can then submit observations. The Committee may also request supplementary or further information from State Parties, especially regarding actions taken in response to the Committee's views or recommendations. When submitting subsequent reports, State Parties should not repeat basic information previously provided. If a State Party is significantly overdue in submitting a report, the Committee may proceed to examine the implementation of the Convention in that State Party based on available reliable information, after notifying the State Party.","State Parties must submit a comprehensive report initially, followed by further information included in reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Other State Parties need to submit reports every five years.","Score: 6
Reason: The student's answer provides several correct details regarding reporting requirements, such as making reports widely available to the public, not repeating basic information in subsequent reports, and the Committee's ability to request supplementary or further information. These additional details are accurate and relevant.

However, the answer significantly omits a crucial reporting requirement explicitly stated in the Ground Truth: that State Parties need to submit reports every five years. This is a fundamental aspect of the reporting frequency. While the answer includes other correct information, the absence of this core reporting period is a major oversight for a question asking about ""reporting requirements."" Additionally, some parts of the answer describe the Committee's examination process or consequences of overdue reports, rather than direct requirements for State Parties to *submit* reports."
